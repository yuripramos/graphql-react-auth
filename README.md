## Purpose?

**Authenticatication** app using prisma and SSR.

It's optimized to **complex applications** if you want to fork in your project and adapt according your needs. This is a **real-world example**.

For simple apps, using third-party authentication is enough but sometimes you want to have control about you are using and don't want use only OAuth or other authentications. Made with TypeScript and reusable components you can adapt this to **any** kind of of project. With prisma the things got way more easier and **you don't need anymore a back-end environment to build from the scratch an authentication**.

First, install

```

then, run your server

```js

```

and last, run the client in a new tab

```js
npm run client or yarn client
```

**Prisma 🛆**

Prisma Client JS is an auto-generated query builder that enables type-safe database access and reduces boilerplate. You can use it as an alternative to traditional ORMs such as Sequelize, TypeORM or SQL query builders like knex.js.
